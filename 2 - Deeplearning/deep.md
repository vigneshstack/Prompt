### 🧠 Deep Blue vs Garry Kasparov (1997)

In 1997, IBM’s **Deep Blue**, a chess-playing computer, defeated reigning world chess champion **Garry Kasparov**. This was the first time a computer beat a human in a professional chess match.

- Used **brute-force search**
- Evaluated 200 million positions per second
- Symbolic AI with pre-programmed rules

> "I'm not afraid to lose to a computer, I'm afraid of what it represents." — Garry Kasparov

## 🤯 Rise of LLMs (Large Language Models)

### 🔍 What Are LLMs?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language. They are based on **transformer architectures** introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al.

### 📈 Timeline of Key Developments
![images/llm-transformer-diagram.png](https://github.com/vigneshstack/Prompt/blob/main/images/transformer.png)
| Year | Model | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2018 | **BERT** | Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers – excels in NLP understanding |
| 2020 | **GPT-3** | 175B parameters – text generation, reasoning, coding |
| 2022 | **ChatGPT** | GPT-based conversational AI with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning |
| 2023+ | **Claude**, **Gemini**, **LLaMA**, **Mistral** | Open and proprietary models with multi-modal capabilities |



### ⚙️ Applications of LLMs

- 🔎 Search Enhancement (Bing, Google SGE)
- 💬 Chat Assistants (ChatGPT, Claude)
- 🛠️ Code Generation (GitHub Copilot)
- 📚 Summarization & Translation
- 🧠 Medical & Legal AI

> “LLMs are not just text generators—they are universal interfaces for reasoning, retrieval, and language.”
