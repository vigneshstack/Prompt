## 🧩 Understanding the Landscape: From AI to Prompt Engineering

| Concept       | What It Means                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🤖 **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** | The simulation of human intelligence by machines. Think: decision-making, pattern recognition. |
| 📊 **Machine Learning (ML)**       | A subset of AI where machines learn from data to make predictions or decisions.                |
| 🧠 **Deep Learning (DL)**          | A branch of ML using neural networks to mimic the human brain—used in image/audio processing. |
| 🧬 **Generative AI (GenAI)**       | A type of AI that creates new content—text, images, code, music—based on patterns in data.    |
| 🎯 **Prompt Techniques**          | The art of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to get desired outputs from language models.   |

### 🎯 AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol (2016)

In 2016, **AlphaGo**, developed by Google DeepMind, defeated **Lee Sedol**, one of the greatest Go players in history.

- Used **deep reinforcement learning** and **policy/value neural networks**
- Played millions of games against itself
- Famous **Move 37** (Game 2) was creative and non-intuitive—shocked human experts
