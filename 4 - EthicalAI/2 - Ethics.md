| ✅ Do's                                                     | ❌ Don'ts                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verify AI-generated content for accuracy                    | Don’t blindly trust AI outputs, especially for sensitive tasks |
| Disclose when AI is used in content creation                | Don’t mislead others into believing AI work is human-made      |
| Use AI to enhance productivity, not replace human oversight | Don’t use AI to bypass academic or professional integrity      |
| Train models on diverse, inclusive datasets                 | Don’t train AI on biased, harmful, or private data             |
| Respect intellectual property and licensing                 | Don’t plagiarize or generate copyrighted content unlawfully    |
| Ensure data privacy and anonymization                       | Don’t input sensitive personal or customer data into AI tools  |

## Framework for Ethical and Responsible Use of AI

A strong ethical framework ensures that AI systems are built and used in a way that is safe, transparent, and aligned with human values.

### 1. **Accountability**

- Assign clear responsibility for how AI is developed, deployed, and used.
- Maintain audit trails of decisions influenced or made by AI.

### 2. **Transparency**

- Explain how the AI system works and what data it uses.
- Ensure outputs can be interpreted and challenged by humans.

### 3. **Fairness & Non-Discrimination**

- Avoid reinforcing stereotypes or systemic bias.
- Test for and correct biased outcomes in algorithms.

### 4. **Privacy & Security**

- Protect user data with encryption and anonymization.
- Use only data with proper consent and authorization.

### 5. **Avoiding Harm**

- Do not use AI to deceive, manipulate, or harm users.
- Regularly assess risks and unintended consequences.

### 6. **Human Oversight**

- Always keep a human in the loop for high-impact decisions.
- Use AI to support—not replace—ethical human judgment.

### 7. **Robustness & Reliability**

- Test systems against edge cases, adversarial input, and failures.
- Ensure resilience and fallback mechanisms are in place.
