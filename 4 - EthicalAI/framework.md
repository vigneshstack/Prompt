## 🧭 Framework for Ethical and Responsible Use of AI

A strong ethical framework ensures that AI systems are built and used in a way that is safe, transparent, and aligned with human values.

### 1. 🧑‍⚖️ **Accountability**

- Assign clear responsibility for how AI is developed, deployed, and used.
- Maintain audit trails of decisions influenced or made by AI.

### 2. 🧠 **Transparency**

- Explain how the AI system works and what data it uses.
- Ensure outputs can be interpreted and challenged by humans.

### 3. 📊 **Fairness & Non-Discrimination**

- Avoid reinforcing stereotypes or systemic bias.
- Test for and correct biased outcomes in algorithms.

### 4. 🔐 **Privacy & Security**

- Protect user data with encryption and anonymization.
- Use only data with proper consent and authorization.

### 5. 🚫 **Avoiding Harm**

- Do not use AI to deceive, manipulate, or harm users.
- Regularly assess risks and unintended consequences.

### 6. 🧭 **Human Oversight**

- Always keep a human in the loop for high-impact decisions.
- Use AI to support—not replace—ethical human judgment.

### 7. 🧪 **Robustness & Reliability**

- Test systems against edge cases, adversarial input, and failures.
- Ensure resilience and fallback mechanisms are in place.
