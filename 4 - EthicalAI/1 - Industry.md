## Challenges in AI Adoption

Despite its potential, AI adoption faces technical, ethical, and organizational hurdles.

### 1. Data Privacy & Security

- Sensitive data may be exposed during training or inference.
- Need for GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific compliance.

### 2. Talent & Skills Gap

- Shortage of qualified AI/ML engineers and data scientists.
- Lack of domain expertise slows implementation.

### 3. Data Quality & Availability

- Incomplete, biased, or unstructured data limits model performance.
- Many companies lack infrastructure for large-scale data handling.

### 4. Model Interpretability

- Black-box models make it hard to explain decisions.
- Especially critical in regulated sectors like healthcare and finance.

### 5. High Costs

- Training and maintaining AI models is expensive.
- Compute, storage, and annotation requirements are resource-heavy.

### 6. Integration with Legacy Systems

- Many enterprises struggle to integrate AI with old IT infrastructure.
