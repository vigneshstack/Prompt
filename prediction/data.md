🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This mini-project demonstrates how we can **predict house prices** based on **house size (in square feet)** using a simple **linear regression model**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

We use a **very basic dataset** of past house sales to train the model:

| Index | Size (sqft) | Price ($1000s) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0     | 500         | 100            |
| 1     | 750         | 150            |
| 2     | 1000        | 200            |
| 3     | 1250        | 250            |
| 4     | 1500        | 300            |
| 5     | 1750        | 350            |
| 6     | 2000        | 400            |

✅ **Pattern**: As size increases, price increases linearly.  
💡 This is a perfect use case for **linear regression**.

## 📈 What’s Plotted

### 1️⃣ Scatter Plot – House Size vs Price
![Plotted](https://github.com/vigneshstack/Prompt/blob/main/prediction/sizeprice.png)

This graph simply shows the **original data points**.

- X-axis: House size in square feet
- Y-axis: Price in $1000s
- Each blue dot = one house sale

📌 This visual helps confirm that the relationship between size and price is **linear**.

### 2️⃣ Regression Plot – Model Prediction

This graph adds:
- 🔵 Original data points (blue)
- 🔴 A **regression line** (red) learned by the model
- 🟢 A **prediction point** for a 1600 sqft house

📍 The model learns the pattern:
> Every additional 250 sqft increases the price by ~$50,000

📌 Based on this, it predicts:
 🏡 **1600 sqft → ~$320,000**

## 🤖 How It’s Predicted

1. **Model Used**: Linear Regression  
2. **Feature**: House size (in sqft)  
3. **Target**: Price (in $1000s)  
4. **Training**: Model is trained on past data  
5. **Prediction**: We ask the model to estimate price for a 1600 sqft house
